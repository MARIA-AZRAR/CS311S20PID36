It was found out that after storing the bits denoted particular characters the file stores the garbage value to complete the byte of a character.
so, to solve that bug defined a variable PSEUDO_EOF of int datatype and stores a value that can be ocurr for character storation like 254, or some 
large value can also be stored. So, as long as file encoding hits that value the file ended. Basically, the PSEUDO_EOF marks the end of the encoding.
